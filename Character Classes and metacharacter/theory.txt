Specify Pattern Using RegEx:
To specify regular expressions, metacharacters are used.
MetaCharacters:
Metacharacters are characters that are interpreted in a special way by a RegEx engine. Here's a list of 
metacharacters:

[] . ^ $ * + ? {} () \ |

Character Classes
Square brackets surrounding a pattern of characters are called a character class e.g. [abc]. A character class 
always matches a single character out of a list of specified characters that means the expression [abc] 
matches only a, b or c character.

Negated character classes can also be defined that match any character except those contained within the 
brackets. A negated character class is defined by placing a caret (^) symbol immediately after the opening 
bracket, like [^abc], which matches any character except a, b, and c.

You can also define a range of characters by using the hyphen (-) character inside a character class, 
like [0-9].
[] - Square brackets

Square brackets specify a set of characters you wish to match.

Expression	String	Matched?
[abc]	a	1 match
ac	2 matches
Hey Jude	No match
abc de ca	5 matches
Here, [abc] will match if the string you are trying to match contains any of the a, b or c.

You can also specify a range of characters using - inside square brackets.

[a-e] is the same as [abcde].

[1-4] is the same as [1234].

[0-39] is the same as [01239].

You can complement (invert) the character set by using caret ^ symbol at the start of a square-bracket.

[^abc] means any character except a or b or c.

[^0-9] means any non-digit character.

Regular Expression Flags
Flags are used with regular expressions that allow various options such as global search, case-insensitive 
search, etc. They can be used separately or together.

Flags	Description
g	Performs a global match (find all matches)
m	Performs multiline match
i	Performs case-insensitive matching
