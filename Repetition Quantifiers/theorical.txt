Repetition Quantifiers:

we've learnt how to match a single character in a variety of fashions. But what if you want to match on more 
than one character? For example, let's say you want to find out words containing one or more instances of the 
letter p, or words containing at least two p's, and so on.

This is where quantifiers come into play. With quantifiers you can specify how many times a character in a 
regular expression should match. Quantifiers can be applied to the individual characters, as well as classes 
of characters, and groups of characters contained by the parentheses.
