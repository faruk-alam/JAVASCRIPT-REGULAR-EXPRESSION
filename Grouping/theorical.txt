Grouping:
Regular expressions use parentheses to group subexpressions, just like mathematical expressions. Parentheses 
allow a repetition quantifier to be applied to an entire subexpression.

For example, in regexp /go+/ the quantifier + is applied only to the last character o and it matches the 
strings "go", "goo", and so on. Whereas, in regexp /(go)+/ the quantifier + is applied to the group of 
characters g and o and it matches the strings "go", "gogo", and so on


Note: If the string matches the pattern, the match() method returns an array containing the entire matched 
string as the first element, followed by any results captured in parentheses, and the index of the whole 
match. If no matches were found, it returns null.

Tip: If the regular expression includes the g flag, the match() method only returns an array containing all 
matched substrings rather than match object. Captured groups, index of the whole match, and other properties 
are not returned.
