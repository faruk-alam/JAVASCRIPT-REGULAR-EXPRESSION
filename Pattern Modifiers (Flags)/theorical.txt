Pattern Modifiers (Flags)
A pattern modifier allows you to control the way a pattern match is handled. Pattern modifiers are placed 
directly after the regular expression, for example, if you want to search for a pattern in a case-insensitive 
manner, you can use the i modifier, like this: /pattern/i.

The following table lists some of the most commonly used pattern modifiers.

Modifier	What it Does
g	Perform a global match i.e. finds all occurrences.
i	Makes the match case-insensitive manner.
m	Changes the behavior of ^ and $ to match against a newline boundary (i.e. start or end of each line 
    within a multiline string), instead of a string boundary.
o	Evaluates the expression only once.
s	Changes the behavior of . (dot) to match all characters, including newlines.
x	Allows you to use whitespace and comments within a regular expression for clarity.
